# SQL Data Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a SQL-based data analysis assignment completed as part of a BI Data Analyst internship application.  
The goal of the task was to analyze structured data, address data quality issues and answer business-oriented analytical questions using SQL.

The focus of this project is on clear analytical reasoning, readable SQL and reproducible results rather than advanced optimisation.

## Dataset
The dataset represents anonymized gameplay data from a PvP-style game environment.  
Each row corresponds to one player participating in a round of a match.

The data includes information about:
- Matches and rounds
- Players and teams
- Player skill levels
- Round outcomes and durations

All identifiers and values have been anonymized and no sensitive or proprietary data is included.

---

## Tasks Covered
The assignment required answering a series of analytical questions, including:

- Cleaning and validating noisy data (e.g. duplicate or invalid rounds)
- Aggregating round-level data to match-level metrics
- Calculating team skill values based on player-level data
- Analyzing win rates based on team skill differences
- Performing bucket-based analysis to identify thresholds and patterns
- Reasoning about analytical approaches and assumptions

---

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL** (CTEs, joins, aggregations, CASE statements)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Analytical problem-solving
- Structured reasoning and documentation
- Clear, commented query writing

---

## Repository Structure
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries answering the assignment questions, with comments explaining logic and assumptions
- `analysis_summary.md` – Summary of key findings and insights

---

## Notes
This project was completed independently and focuses on demonstrating how to approach real-world analytical tasks in a clear and structured way.  
The emphasis is on correctness, readability and analytical thinking rather than complex SQL features.
